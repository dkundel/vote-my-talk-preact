# Vote My Talk (Final Version)

This project has been created with [`create-react-app`](https://npm.im/create-react-app) and uses [`react-app-rewired`](https://npm.im/react-app-rewired).

## What is this about?

This project is showing in a very basic way how to use a web component in a React/Preact app. While the code is React at the moment, we are using [`react-app-rewire-preact`](https://npm.im/react-app-rewire-preact) to dynamically convert it to [`preact`](https://npm.im/preact) with the help of `preact-compat`. At the current moment the compatibility with Web Components is better in Preact allowing you to use custom events and to set complex data as properties rather than attributes.

There is also an Angular version of this project: [dkundel/vote-my-talk](https://github.com/dkundel/vote-my-talk)

## How to get started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dkundel/vote-my-talk-preact.git
cd vote-my-talk-preact
npm install
npm start
```
